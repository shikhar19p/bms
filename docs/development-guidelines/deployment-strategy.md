# Deployment Strategy and CI/CD

This document outlines the deployment strategy and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for the BookMySportz monorepo. Our goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment processes to ensure rapid, reliable, and consistent delivery of software updates to production and other environments.

## 1. Environments

We maintain distinct environments to support the software development lifecycle:

*   **Development (Local):** Developers work on their local machines. Changes are tested locally before being pushed to version control.
*   **Staging:** A pre-production environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. Used for final testing, quality assurance, and stakeholder reviews before production deployment.
*   **Production:** The live environment accessible to end-users.

## 2. Version Control Workflow

Our deployment process is tightly integrated with our Git branching strategy (as defined in `[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)`):

*   **`develop` branch:** All feature branches are merged into `develop`. Successful merges to `develop` trigger the CI pipeline, running tests and building artifacts. Deployments to the **Staging** environment are typically triggered from the `develop` branch.
*   **`main` branch:** The `main` branch represents the production-ready code. Merges to `main` (usually from `develop` via a pull request) trigger the CI/CD pipeline for **Production** deployment.

## 3. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

The CI pipeline is triggered on every push to `develop` and `main` branches. Its primary responsibilities are:

1.  **Code Checkout:** Fetch the latest code from the Git repository.
2.  **Dependency Installation:** Install project dependencies using `pnpm install`.
3.  **Linting & Formatting:** Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format --check` to ensure code quality and adherence to style guides.
4.  **Type Checking:** Execute `pnpm typecheck` to catch type-related errors early.
5.  **Build:** Run `pnpm build` (leveraging Turborepo) to build all applications and packages. Turborepo's caching mechanism significantly speeds up this step.
6.  **Unit & Integration Tests:** Execute `pnpm test` (or `turbo test`) to run all unit and integration tests across the monorepo.
7.  **Security Scans (SAST):** Run static application security testing tools to identify vulnerabilities in the codebase and dependencies.
8.  **Artifact Generation:** Package the built applications (e.g., Docker images for backend services, static assets for frontend apps).
9.  **Reporting:** Generate test reports, code coverage reports, and security scan results.

**Failure in any CI step will halt the pipeline and prevent further progression.**

## 4. Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipeline

Upon successful completion of the CI pipeline, the CD pipeline takes over to deploy the artifacts.

### a. Staging Environment Deployment

*   **Trigger:** Automatically triggered on successful CI build from the `develop` branch.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Pull the latest Docker images (for backend) or deploy static assets (for frontend).
    2.  Run database migrations (if any) against the staging database.
    3.  Perform smoke tests and basic health checks.
    4.  Notify relevant stakeholders of the successful staging deployment.

### b. Production Environment Deployment

*   **Trigger:** Manually triggered after successful testing and approval in the Staging environment (e.g., via a button in the CI/CD platform).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Blue/Green or Canary Deployment (Recommended):** To minimize downtime and risk, we will implement advanced deployment strategies:
        *   **Blue/Green:** Deploy the new version (Green) alongside the old version (Blue). Once Green is validated, traffic is switched. If issues arise, traffic can be quickly reverted to Blue.
        *   **Canary:** Gradually roll out the new version to a small subset of users. Monitor for issues, and if stable, gradually increase the rollout. Rollback if issues are detected.
    2.  Pull the latest Docker images or deploy static assets.
    3.  Run database migrations (if any) against the production database (with proper backup and rollback strategies).
    4.  Perform comprehensive health checks and post-deployment validation.
    5.  Monitor application performance and logs closely after deployment.
    6.  Notify relevant stakeholders of the successful production deployment.

## 5. Infrastructure and Tools

*   **CI/CD Platform:** (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI) - *To be decided based on project needs and existing infrastructure.*
*   **Containerization:** Docker for packaging backend services.
*   **Orchestration:** (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) - *To be decided for managing containerized applications.*
*   **Cloud Provider:** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) - *To be decided for hosting infrastructure.*
*   **Database Migrations:** Prisma Migrate for managing database schema changes.

## 6. Best Practices for CI/CD

*   **Automate Everything:** Minimize manual steps to reduce errors and increase speed.
*   **Fast Feedback:** Ensure pipelines run quickly to provide rapid feedback to developers.
*   **Idempotent Deployments:** Deployments should be repeatable and produce the same result every time.
*   **Rollback Capability:** Always have a clear and tested rollback plan in case of deployment failures.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Integrate monitoring and alerting into the pipeline to detect issues immediately after deployment.
*   **Security:** Implement security best practices throughout the pipeline (e.g., secret management, image scanning).
*   **Small, Frequent Deployments:** Deploy smaller changes more frequently to reduce risk and simplify debugging.

This strategy provides a robust framework for managing the deployment of the BookMySportz monorepo, ensuring high quality and efficient delivery.
