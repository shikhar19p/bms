# Testing Strategy for BookMySportz Monorepo

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the BookMySportz monorepo, focusing on ensuring production-level quality, reliability, performance, and security. A multi-faceted approach to testing is crucial for a complex application like BookMySportz, which comprises multiple frontend applications, backend services, and shared packages.

## 1. Testing Philosophy

Our testing philosophy adheres to the **Testing Pyramid** (or Ice Cream Cone, depending on interpretation), emphasizing a higher number of fast, isolated tests at the lower levels and fewer, more comprehensive tests at the higher levels.

*   **Unit Tests:** Fast, isolated, and cover individual components/functions.
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components/modules.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate real user journeys across the entire system.

## 2. Types of Tests and Implementation

### a. Unit Tests

*   **Purpose:** To test individual functions, methods, classes, or small modules in isolation, ensuring they work as expected under various conditions.
*   **Scope:** All `apps/` and `packages/` workspaces.
    *   **Backend (`http-backend`, `ws-backend`, `backend-common`, `common`, `db`):** Individual service methods, utility functions, data access layer functions, middleware logic.
    *   **Frontend (`admin-web`, `user-web`, `ui`):** Individual React components (pure functions, UI elements), custom hooks, utility functions.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Jest:** Primary testing framework for all TypeScript/JavaScript codebases.
    *   **React Testing Library:** For testing React components in a way that encourages good accessibility practices and focuses on user behavior.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Isolation:** Mock external dependencies (e.g., database calls, API requests, external services) to ensure tests are fast and deterministic.
    *   **Granularity:** Each test should focus on a single unit of work.
    *   **Fast Execution:** Unit tests should run quickly to provide rapid feedback during development.
    *   **Clear Naming:** Test files and test cases should be clearly named to indicate what they are testing.
*   **Execution:** `pnpm test` or `turbo test` (for all workspaces) or `pnpm --filter=<workspace-name> test` (for specific workspace).

### b. Integration Tests

*   **Purpose:** To verify the interactions between multiple units or components, ensuring they work correctly when combined.
*   **Scope:** Primarily backend services (`http-backend`, `ws-backend`) and interactions between frontend components and their local state/props.
    *   **Backend:** Controller-service interactions, service-database interactions, multiple middleware working together.
    *   **Frontend:** Components interacting with Context API, Redux stores (if any), or other shared state.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Jest:** For test runner and assertions.
    *   **Supertest:** For testing HTTP API endpoints by making actual HTTP requests to the Express.js application.
    *   **Test Databases:** Use dedicated test databases (e.g., a separate PostgreSQL instance or an in-memory database if suitable) for database-related integration tests to ensure isolation from development data.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Realistic Interactions:** Test the actual flow of data and control between integrated components.
    *   **Controlled Environment:** Use test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies) for external systems (e.g., third-party APIs, email services) that are not part of the integration being tested.
    *   **Setup/Teardown:** Ensure proper setup and teardown of test data and environment for each test suite.

### c. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

*   **Purpose:** To simulate real user scenarios and interactions with the entire application, from the user interface through the backend services and database.
*   **Scope:** Critical user journeys in `admin-web` and `user-web`.
    *   User registration and login.
    *   Venue search and booking flow.
    *   Admin approval workflows.
    *   Password reset flow.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Cypress or Playwright:** Modern, reliable E2E testing frameworks.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Focus on Critical Paths:** Prioritize testing the most important user flows.
    *   **Dedicated Test Environment:** Run E2E tests against a deployed or locally running instance of the full application stack.
    *   **Idempotency:** Design tests to be repeatable and not leave behind dirty data.
    *   **Visual Regression Testing (Optional):** Integrate tools to detect unintended UI changes.

### d. API Tests (Functional & Contract)

*   **Purpose:** To verify that backend API endpoints function correctly, adhere to defined contracts (schemas), and handle various inputs and error conditions gracefully.
*   **Scope:** `http-backend` API endpoints.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Jest & Supertest:** For functional API testing.
    *   **Postman/Newman or OpenAPI/Swagger tools:** For automated contract testing against API specifications.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Test all possible valid and invalid inputs.
    *   **Error Handling:** Verify correct error responses for different scenarios (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
    *   **Schema Validation:** Ensure API responses conform to expected JSON schemas.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:** Test endpoints with different user roles and permissions.

### e. Performance Tests (Load & Stress)

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate the system's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various load conditions.
*   **Scope:** `http-backend` and `ws-backend`.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **JMeter, K6, or Artillery:** For simulating concurrent users and measuring response times, throughput, and error rates.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Realistic Scenarios:** Simulate typical and peak user loads based on expected usage patterns.
    *   **Identify Bottlenecks:** Pinpoint areas of the application that degrade under load.
    *   **Monitor Resources:** Track CPU, memory, network, and database utilization during tests.

### f. Security Tests (Vulnerability Scanning & Penetration Testing)

*   **Purpose:** To identify security vulnerabilities in the application and its dependencies.
*   **Scope:** Entire application stack.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** Tools like Snyk or SonarQube for scanning source code and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):** Tools like OWASP ZAP for actively scanning the running application for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Manual Penetration Testing:** Conducted by security experts to uncover complex vulnerabilities.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Regular Scans:** Integrate automated security scans into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Dependency Audits:** Regularly check for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   **Security Headers:** Ensure proper security headers are configured.

### g. Accessibility Tests (A11y)

*   **Purpose:** To ensure the frontend applications are usable by individuals with disabilities.
*   **Scope:** `admin-web`, `user-web`, `ui` package components.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Axe-core:** Integrated into unit/integration tests (e.g., with Jest-axe) for automated accessibility checks.
    *   **Lighthouse:** For auditing web page accessibility.
    *   **Manual Audits:** Conducted by human testers using assistive technologies.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Early Integration:** Incorporate accessibility checks early in the development cycle.
    *   **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML elements.
    *   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are navigable via keyboard.

## 3. Monorepo Testing Strategy

### a. Turborepo Integration

*   **`turbo test`:** The root `package.json` will define a `test` script that leverages Turborepo to run tests across all relevant workspaces. This allows for parallel execution and caching of test results.
*   **`dependsOn`:** Configure `turbo.json` to ensure that dependencies are built and tested before dependent applications (e.g., `db` tests run before `http-backend` tests).

### b. Workspace-Specific Test Suites

Each application and package will have its own dedicated test suite and configuration (`jest.config.js`, `tsconfig.json` for tests) within its respective directory.

### c. Shared Test Utilities

Consider creating a `packages/test-utils` (or similar) package to centralize common test helpers, mock data, and testing configurations that can be shared across different workspaces.

### d. CI/CD Integration

All tests (unit, integration, E2E, API, security scans) will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that no new code is merged without passing the required quality gates. This provides fast feedback and prevents regressions.

## 4. Best Practices Summary

*   **Shift-Left Testing:** Integrate testing activities as early as possible in the development lifecycle.
*   **Test Data Management:** Implement strategies for creating, managing, and cleaning up test data to ensure test isolation and repeatability.
*   **Mocking/Stubbing:** Effectively use test doubles to isolate components and control external dependencies.
*   **Clear Test Naming:** Write descriptive test names that explain the purpose of the test.
*   **Maintainability:** Keep tests clean, readable, and maintainable. Refactor tests as the code evolves.
*   **Code Coverage:** Aim for high code coverage, but understand that coverage alone does not guarantee quality. Focus on testing critical paths and complex logic.
*   **Fast Feedback Loops:** Optimize test execution times to provide quick feedback to developers.

By implementing this comprehensive testing strategy, we aim to deliver a high-quality, reliable, and secure BookMySportz platform.
