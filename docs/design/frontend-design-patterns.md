# Frontend Design Patterns

This document outlines the key design patterns and architectural principles applied across the frontend applications (`admin-web`, `user-web`) in the BookMySportz monorepo. Adhering to these patterns ensures consistency, maintainability, scalability, and a high-quality user experience.

## 1. Component-Driven Development (CDD)

*   **Principle:** Building UIs from the bottom-up, starting with small, isolated components and progressively combining them to form larger structures.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **`@workspace/ui` package:** Houses a shared library of reusable UI components (atoms, molecules, organisms) built in isolation.
    *   **Storybook (Future):** Components in `@workspace/ui` can be developed and showcased in isolation using Storybook, facilitating collaboration and testing.
*   **Benefits:** Promotes reusability, improves consistency, simplifies testing, and accelerates development.

## 2. Atomic Design Methodology

We loosely follow the Atomic Design methodology to structure our components:

*   **Atoms:** Basic HTML tags or fundamental UI elements (e.g., `Button`, `Input`, `Icon`).
*   **Molecules:** Groups of atoms bonded together to form a functional unit (e.g., `SearchBar`, `LoginForm`).
*   **Organisms:** Groups of molecules and/or atoms joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface (e.g., `Header`, `VenueCard`).
*   **Templates:** Page-level objects that place components into a layout.
*   **Pages:** Specific instances of templates with real content.

## 3. State Management

Frontend applications primarily use React's built-in state management capabilities.

*   **Local Component State:** For UI-specific state that doesn't need to be shared (e.g., form input values, toggle states).
*   **Context API:** For sharing state across a component tree without prop-drilling (e.g., theme settings, authentication status).
*   **React Query / SWR (Future Consideration):** For managing server-side data fetching, caching, and synchronization, reducing the need for complex global state management libraries.

## 4. Data Fetching

*   **HTTP Client:** `axios` is used as the primary HTTP client for making API requests to the `http-backend`.
*   **Hooks for Data Fetching:** Custom hooks (e.g., `useFetchVenues`) are used to encapsulate data fetching logic, providing a clean interface for components.
*   **Error Handling:** API call errors are caught and handled gracefully, displaying user-friendly messages (e.g., using `sonner` for toasts).

## 5. Styling

*   **Tailwind CSS:** Used for utility-first CSS styling, enabling rapid UI development and consistent design.
*   **`clsx` and `tailwind-merge`:** Used for conditionally applying Tailwind classes and merging them intelligently to avoid conflicts.
*   **Radix UI:** Utilized for unstyled, accessible UI primitives (e.g., `Dialog`, `DropdownMenu`, `Select`), which are then styled with Tailwind CSS.

## 6. Routing

*   **Next.js App Router:** Leverages Next.js's App Router for file-system based routing, server components, and advanced data fetching capabilities.

## 7. Accessibility (A11y)

*   **Radix UI Primitives:** Provide a strong foundation for accessible components with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
*   **Semantic HTML:** Using appropriate HTML elements for their intended purpose.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensuring all interactive elements are navigable and usable via keyboard.
*   **Color Contrast:** Adhering to WCAG guidelines for color contrast.

## 8. Performance Optimization

*   **Image Optimization:** Leveraging Next.js's `Image` component for automatic image optimization.
*   **Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically handles code splitting, loading only the necessary JavaScript for each page.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Dynamically importing components that are not immediately needed.
*   **Caching:** Utilizing browser caching and potentially server-side caching for API responses.

By applying these design patterns, we aim to build performant, maintainable, and user-friendly frontend applications for BookMySportz.
